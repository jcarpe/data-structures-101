# Data Structures 101

![GitHub Actions Workflow Status](https://img.shields.io/github/actions/workflow/status/jcarpe/data-structures-101/main.yml)

## Summary

This just represents a bit of an academic exercise to build & illustrate basic data structures in Typescript. They are built with bun as the runtime, and uses the bun test runner.

Notably, this is an academic exercise. Many of these data structures are redundant to what is already available in Javascript & Node, but are intended to illustrate basic data structure concepts.

The examples are results of following the following course available on Udemy: https://www.udemy.com/course/data-structures-and-algorithms-bootcamp/
